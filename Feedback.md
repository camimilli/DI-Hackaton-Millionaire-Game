Camilla and Niv,

You did a very impressive project, your choice was ambitious and you executed it beautifully.
Your code is clean and readable. 
Adding a bit more structure with folders or separating functions into different files would make your project even more organized and easier to understand.

I especially appreciate the comments you added to each function and step; they make it much easier to follow your logic and decisions.

You successfully used all the features we learned in class, and even went beyond that, great work, this makes your Hackathon project very complete. 
The UI is also clean and easy to use, which adds a lot to the overall experience.

Itâ€™s also clear that you worked very well together as a team, which is impressive and a great skill to keep developing.

Great job, keep up the good work!
